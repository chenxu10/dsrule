## Principles

- **Define**(What's input, what's output, what's constraint) and **close**(What's the output you want, a minimal hello world example with specialized case) the scope of the problem first(Convince yourself and the whole team why you need to do this?)

  **Always always close close the scope of the problem first!** *Your mind needs an end, needs short iteration cycle, needs metrics to see feedback, open loop will burn all your energy*
